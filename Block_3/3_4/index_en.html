                        Color vision far exceeds ours as well. The middle section of each eye, the middle band, consists
                        of six parallel bands. The first four are loaded with eight different types of sensitive cells
                        light (photoreceptors), containing pigments that respond to different wavelengths of light. With

                        Your vision has the same concept as a DVD player, only more efficient. Their eyes stay on the
                        tip of the sticks and move independently of each other. Each eye has "trinocular vision" - it
                        can measure depth and distance by on its own, focusing on objects with three separate regions.
                        They can see a special type of spiral light called circular polarized light that no other animal
                        can see. And they have a structure similar to technology found in CD and DVD players, but much
                        more effective. <br> <br>
                                            Most people have three types of light-detecting cells, or photoreceptors, in
                        their retinas. These are sensitive to red, green and blue light, respectively. Birds, reptiles
                        and many fish have a fourth photoreceptor that detects ultraviolet light. Four it is enough.
                        Mathematical models tell us that you only need four receivers, maybe five, to effectively encode
                        the colors within that range. <br> <br>

                                            The mantis shrimp has twelve different photoreceptors. Eight of them cover
                        the parts of the spectrum that we can see, while four cover the ultraviolet region. That it
                        seems a ridiculous excess. If four or five receptors are all that an animal need, "why the hell
                        do stomatoopods need 12 channels?" says Justin Marshall, who led the new study.

                        In April 1998, an aggressive creature named Tyson smashed the glass wall ofhis six-inch-thick
                        cell. Soon he was overwhelmed by attendants nervous and moved to a safer facility in Great
                        Yarmouth. To Unlike his heavy namesake, Tyson was only four inches tall.

                        relatives, can throw one of nature's fastest and most powerful punches. He was a mantis shrimp.

                                            Mantis shrimp are aggressive relatives of crabs and lobsters and attack
                        other animals, crippling them with devastating blows. Their secret weapons are a pair of
                                            articulated arms folded under the head, which they can unfold at speeds
                        incredible. <br> <br>

                                            "Lance" species have arms ending in a diabolical and barbed spike that they
                        use to impale soft-bodied prey like fish. But the species larger 'crushers' have arms ending in
                        heavy clubs and use them to punch with the same force as a rifle bullet.
